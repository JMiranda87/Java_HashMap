# HashMap and TreeMap Processing Lab

This lab explores and demonstrates the usage of HashMap and TreeMap in Java, utilizing their built-in methods.

## Files included:

1. ExampleOneHashMap.java - Demonstrates removing elements from a HashMap
2. ExampletwoHashMap.java - Shows creating, copying, and removing elements from a HashMap
3. exampleTreemapOne.java - Illustrates removing elements from a TreeMap
4. exampleTreemapTwo.java - Demonstrates navigation methods in TreeMap
5. CustomComparator.java - Custom comparator for TreeMap
6. maincomparator.java - Uses the custom comparator with TreeMap

## Running the examples:

To run each example, use the following command in the terminal:

```
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Replace `FileName` with the name of the Java file you want to run.

For example, to run ExampleOneHashMap:

```
javac ExampleOneHashMap.java
java ExampleOneHashMap
```

Repeat this process for each file to see the output of all examples.
